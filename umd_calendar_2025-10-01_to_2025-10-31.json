Rather than seeking to preserve the past, these artists embrace the distortion, abstraction, and reinvention of memories, inviting the audience to consider alternative ways of remembering."

Queer dreaming exists across generations: in whispered hopes, in coded language passed in bars and ballrooms, in the brave declarations of those who demanded to be seen. We dream not only of safety, but of possibility. In dreaming together, we create a lineage of vision that connects our past, sustains our present, and propels us toward the futures we deserve.\n\nThis October, we celebrate the dreams that brought us here and commit to the ones that will carry us forward.

As a tactile form of communication, Protactile requires a different model of performance. Actors and audience members interact directly. In this production, a collaboration between PT411, Richmond Area Black Deaf Advocates, and TDPS, audiences will experience a moving journey through the lives of nineteenth-century DeafBlind slaves. Knowledge of Protactile or American Sign Language is NOT required for this production. Actors will adapt their performance to fit each person’s needs.\n\nProtactile is a physical language and involves direct contact with actors. Safe touch zones are part of Protactile. These include arms, front parts of legs, collarbone area, and head. Audience members will be blindfolded during the show.\n\nDue to the topic, this show is recommended for mature teenagers and adults only. Run time is approximately 15 minutes, with reflection time afterwards. Please arrive 15 minutes before your ticked time. If you arrive late, you may not be able to attend the show."

Hailed “one of modern jazz’s most innovative musicians” by Glide Magazine, Christian McBride says, “Brad is justifiably revered as one of the greatest pianists of all time. I’m very proud to have been friends and cohorts with him for almost 35 years. He was one of the first people I met when I moved to New York City in 1989, and it continues to be an uplifting experience every time we play together.” Named “one of our greatest living pianists” by NPR, Brad Mehldau says, “It is a dream come true to play with Christian in this duo setting. Playing with Christian, especially in this configuration, is both joyful and daunting all at once. His level of sophistication and swing, of emotional power and grace, is unsurpassed–not in the least on what he has achieved on his instrument, but also as one of our strongest voices in the music more generally, at the top of his game. I’m so honored to be on stage with him.” This longtime friendship and musical camaraderie has led to various collaborations through the years including the albums MoodSwing (1994), RoundAgain (2020) and LongGone (2023) with Joshua Redman and Brian Blade; trio tour dates with drummer Marcus Gilmore; and a recent duo performance at the Big Ears Festival that had the crowd utterly captivated."

Based in the Garden of Reflection & Remembrance at the Memorial Chapel , participants learn about trees and plants while having their newborns along.\n\nParental leave and the welcoming of a new child can be lonely and stressful. By offering a tour specifically for new parents and caregivers, participants can interact as much (or as little) as they wish with other adults and have a focus in order to leave the house. According to the National Institutes of Health, one in seven women will develop postpartum depression and many others will still experience feelings of loneliness and isolation during parental leave. These symptoms can affect all genders, adoptive parents, and all caregivers, not just the birth parent. Things like cost, transportation, and child care can hinder access to alleviating symptoms. The Arboretum aims to make the outdoors and public gardens more accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are in life's journey."

Put Away the Fire, Dear is a group dance-theater work unraveling American cinema, in which six marginalized characters defy their inherited roles and reimagine new narratives for themselves. Jumping through portals spanning reality and cinema, they change the lens, uprooting power and their distorted existence. We connect with those of the past like Zora Neale Hurston, Oscar Michaux, Ethel Waters, Bojangles and onwards. This work invites BIPOC audiences to see their worlds reflected and offers collective liberation in dreaming of our unwritten stories. In 100 minutes, this wild dance-theater production breaks down whose imagination we are living in with shifting scenic design by Dyer Rhoads and live music by Alex MacKinnon. Following her recent run at Chelsea Factory NY (2025) and American Dance Festival (2024), Farrish’s company makes its Clarice Presents debut with the D.C. area premiere of this vibrant multimedia performance."

UMSO is then joined by the UMD Concert Choir, led by Director of Choral Activities Jason Max Ferdinand, for a moving rendition of Robert Nathaniel Dett’s The Chariot Jubilee , a piece widely acknowledged to be the first-ever symphonic work based solely on African American spirituals.\n\nIn partnership with Clarice Presents, UMSO will feature internationally renowned pianist Marc-André Hamelin for George Gershwin’s Concerto in F. Gershwin’s signature style and inspirations come together in a spectacularly catchy piece that demonstrates the full virtuosity of the piano in a true American style: jazz.\n\nThe performance concludes with Antonin Dvořák's immortal ninth symphony, “From the New World.” Composed during his time at the National Conservatory in New York, Dvořák was deeply inspired by the folk music of Indigenous and African American communities. The result is a work full of rich stories and motifs that create a vision of the American spirit rarely acknowledged in his time."

    "description": "Pianist Marc-André Hamelin, a “performer of near-superhuman technical prowess” (The New York Times), is equally renowned for both the brilliant technique he applies to the great works of the classical repertoire and his adventurous exploration with lesser heard gems from the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. Hamelin’s Clarice Presents recital begins with one of his signature performance pieces, Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 29. Better known as the “Hammerklavier,” this immensely challenging 45-minute masterpiece is a spectacular showcase for Hamelin's stunning technical skill. Hamelin then moves on to Robert Schumann's underheard nine-movement cycle, Waldszenen , Op. 82. A haunting and robustly romantic journey through a woodland landscape, these nuanced forest scenes offer a mysterious glimpse into the troubled mind of a famed composer nearing the end of his too-short career. The performance concludes with Maurice Ravel's Gaspard de la Nuit . This triptych of poetic fables features lyrical passages and profound harmonies."

    "description": "The Celluloid Atlantic changes the way we look at American and Italian cinema in the postwar period. In the thirty years following World War II, American and Italian film industries came to be an integrated, transnational unit rather than two separate, nation-based entities. Written in jargon-free prose and based on previously unexplored archival sources, this book revisits the history of Neorealism, World War II combat cinema, the \"Western all'Italiana,\" and the career of John Kitzmiller, the African American star who made Italy his home and was the first person of color to win the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival. The Celluloid Atlantic makes the trailblazing argument that culturally hybrid genres like the so-called spaghetti Western were less the exceptions than the norm. Giovacchini argues that the waning of the Celluloid Atlantic in the early 1970s was due to the economic policies of the first Nixon administration, specifically its important, but largely neglected, Revenue Act of 1971, as well as to the ideological debates between Europeans and Americans that intensified during the American intervention in Vietnam.\n\nSaverio Giovacchini is Professor of History at the University of Maryland where he has served as the director of the Nathan and Jeanette Miller Center for Historical Studies on two occasions (2010-3; 2021-2). He is the author of Hollywood Modernism (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2001) and Celluloid Atlantic: Hollywood, Cinecittà and the Cinema of the West, 1943-1973 (Albany, NY: Suny Press, 2025). With Robert Sklar, he has edited Global Neorealism: The Transnational History of a Film Style (Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 2012). His new book project centers on the transnational career of film director Oscar “Budd” Boetticher (1916-2001)."

Based in the Garden of Reflection & Remembrance at the Memorial Chapel , participants learn about trees and plants while having their newborns along.\n\nParental leave and the welcoming of a new child can be lonely and stressful. By offering a tour specifically for new parents and caregivers, participants can interact as much (or as little) as they wish with other adults and have a focus in order to leave the house. According to the National Institutes of Health, one in seven women will develop postpartum depression and many others will still experience feelings of loneliness and isolation during parental leave. These symptoms can affect all genders, adoptive parents, and all caregivers, not just the birth parent. Things like cost, transportation, and child care can hinder access to alleviating symptoms. The Arboretum aims to make the outdoors and public gardens more accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are in life's journey."

The Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus can trace its beginnings directly to 1902, when ethnographer Hnat Khotkevych formed the first UBC orchestra. A devoted core group of 17 musicians saw the ensemble through World War II, ensuring that the collective would continue to tour under the Chorus umbrella for well over a century.

In this talk, we’ll examine script drafts and other materials from the film held in Maryland’s Special Collections for the Performing Arts, and we’ll follow the film’s development as Henson and his team tested just how far they could push audiences who were expecting a whimsical family puppet fantasy.\n\nFollowing the talk, stick around to check out Dark Crystal materials from the Special Collections in Performing Arts (SCPA).

Opening the program is Israfel , an invigorating orchestral work from the U.K.-based composer Mark Simpson that will premiere in Glasgow with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in 2015. The BSO continues with a powerhouse presentation of Sergei Prokofiev's intensely dramatic Violin Concerto No. 2 in G Minor, featuring a masterful violin solo from virtuosic Italian-American instrumentalist Francesca Dego. Closing the performance is the cinematically enrapturing Symphonie fantastique , Hector Berlioz's first (and likely best known) major symphony. His somewhat autobiographical story of a heartbroken lover's mad opium trip established Berlioz at the forefront of the new progressive composers of his time and retains the power to astound nearly two centuries later. The evening closes with an on-stage discussion between Heyward and Stephanie Shonekan, dean of the University of Maryland College of Arts and Humanities."

Their sensorial works, made from makeup, salt, clay, wood, fabric, and their own bodies, invite viewers to feel the realities of surviving and confront the inextricable links between sexual violence and the institutions that create it. These artists exemplify the ingenuity of resistance. Their work generates possibilities for a future rooted in the experiences and identities of the artists, as queer, trans, multi-racial, disabled, Indigenous, Mexican, and Black.\n\nEach body of art will be displayed alongside the artists’ contributions to the Monument Quilt , a collective project comprised of 3,000 stories from survivors of sexual violence, emblazoned on fabric and displayed in public places. In the spirit of the now concluded Monument Quilt, a series of banners made by UMD students will be on view."

Based in the Garden of Reflection & Remembrance at the Memorial Chapel , participants learn about trees and plants while having their newborns along.\n\nParental leave and the welcoming of a new child can be lonely and stressful. By offering a tour specifically for new parents and caregivers, participants can interact as much (or as little) as they wish with other adults and have a focus in order to leave the house. According to the National Institutes of Health, one in seven women will develop postpartum depression and many others will still experience feelings of loneliness and isolation during parental leave. These symptoms can affect all genders, adoptive parents, and all caregivers, not just the birth parent. Things like cost, transportation, and child care can hinder access to alleviating symptoms. The Arboretum aims to make the outdoors and public gardens more accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are in life's journey."

(Lets Go Then, Let's Do This!)\n\nFor many, the connection to land and waters is at the center of our Native and Indigenous culture and history. Our ancestors walked the land before us – in trails of both blood and earth, steady rhythm on soil and stone. What we know as America is native land, one of many nations and peoples, now home to several more.\n\nFrom Alcatraz Island to Washington, D.C., the longest walks moved mountains in policies, in affirming native sovereignty. Where there are many tribes and nations shaped a movement of collective identity, a political power. From Standing Rock to Wounded Knee, we invoke the memory and history of our collective resistance.\n\nDuring these tumultuous times, we draw strength from one another to keep ourselves firmly grounded. This is our rallying cry: Skoden! Stoodis! Let’s go then, let’s do this!"

    "description": "Though Nigeria is the most populous African country, and sometimes called the “Giant of Africa,” Fela's album sheds a sharp light on the reasons why Nigeria has not lived up to its potential. While the text primarily hovers over 1977 (the year of the album's release) as a critical cultural moment in Nigerian history, it also explores the album in the context of a wider look at how colonialism and its aftermath impacted the social, political, and economic environment in Nigeria, and how Western imperialism continues to affect Nigerian identity and life. As we reflect on Nigeria's turbulent post-independent political and social history, Sorrow Tears and Blood offers a rich sonic and lyrical landscape in which to interrogate the potency of Fela's message for generations to come.\n\nStephanie Shonekan is Dean of the College of Arts and Humanities and professor of ethnomusicology at the University of Maryland. Previously was a faculty member and administrator at the University of Missouri and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Shonekan earned a doctorate in ethnomusicology and folklore with a minor in African American studies in 2003 from Indiana University Bloomington. Her dual heritage combining West Africa\n\nwith the West Indies allows her to straddle the Black world comfortably. She has published articles and book chapters on afrobeat, Fela Kuti, Nigerian and African American hip-hop, soul music and country music. Her publications explore the nexus where identity, history, culture and music meet. Her books include The Life of Camilla Williams: African American Classical Singer and Opera Diva (2011), Soul, Country, and the USA: Race and Identity in American Music Culture (2015), Black Lives Matter & Music (2018), Black Resistance in the Americas (2018), and Dear Department Chair: Letters from Black Women Leaders to the Next\n\nGeneration (2023)."

He holds a master’s degree and a Ph.D. in architecture from the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of The First Modern Building in Mexico (2020) and the co-editor (with Nicholas Temple and Andrzej Piotrowski) of The Routledge Handbook of the Reception of Classical Architecture (2019).

Based in the Garden of Reflection & Remembrance at the Memorial Chapel , participants learn about trees and plants while having their newborns along.\n\nParental leave and the welcoming of a new child can be lonely and stressful. By offering a tour specifically for new parents and caregivers, participants can interact as much (or as little) as they wish with other adults and have a focus in order to leave the house. According to the National Institutes of Health, one in seven women will develop postpartum depression and many others will still experience feelings of loneliness and isolation during parental leave. These symptoms can affect all genders, adoptive parents, and all caregivers, not just the birth parent. Things like cost, transportation, and child care can hinder access to alleviating symptoms. The Arboretum aims to make the outdoors and public gardens more accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are in life's journey."

That same year saw the release of her breakout album, Pursuance: The Coltranes , an intergenerational masterwork that takes the listener on a journey through the lineage of jazz by way of the works of John and Alice Coltrane. She hasn't looked back since. Charismatic and dynamic, Benjamin fuses traditional concepts of jazz, hip-hop and soul. Benjamin has shared stages with such giants as Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, The Roots and Macy Gray, infusing her conception of jazz with the sounds of James Brown, Maceo Parker, Sly and the Family Stone and The Meters to produce soaring, dance-floor worthy rhythms. Her latest album, 2023's Phoenix , features guest appearances from modern legends Diane Reeves, Wayne Shorter, Wallace Roney and Angela Davis.

His work revolves around climate, storytelling, and imagination. At the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society, Ben is working on a book-length project exploring different tools communities can use to imagine their own just, resilient, and dynamic climate futures. The project draws on his dissertation research (“On Human Separatism”) and his practical experience as founder of the Columbia Climate Imaginations Network.

Based in the Garden of Reflection & Remembrance at the Memorial Chapel , participants learn about trees and plants while having their newborns along.\n\nParental leave and the welcoming of a new child can be lonely and stressful. By offering a tour specifically for new parents and caregivers, participants can interact as much (or as little) as they wish with other adults and have a focus in order to leave the house. According to the National Institutes of Health, one in seven women will develop postpartum depression and many others will still experience feelings of loneliness and isolation during parental leave. These symptoms can affect all genders, adoptive parents, and all caregivers, not just the birth parent. Things like cost, transportation, and child care can hinder access to alleviating symptoms. The Arboretum aims to make the outdoors and public gardens more accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are in life's journey."

Turner, Professor of Literary Education.\n\nAbstract: AI’s audio-visual capacities are increasingly capable of mimicking racial markers. By examining AI-powered performances of identity and ethnicity online, the conversation will explore Black affective responses — from eager adoption, to skeptical engagement, to the refusal of uncanny performances of Blackness without Black embodiment.\n\nDr. Rianna Walcott is an Assistant Professor of Communication at the University of Maryland, and Associate Director of the Black Communication and Technology (BCaT) Lab as part of the DISCO Network . An alumna of the London Arts and Humanities Partnership (LAHP), Dr. Walcott earned her PhD in Digital Humanities at King's College London for her research on Black (and specifically Black British) mediated communication, locating the evolution of a hybrid ‘Black British’ identity against the wider Black diaspora. She combines digital research, Black feminist praxis, decolonial studies, arts and culture, and mental health advocacy in her work. In the time left over, she moonlights as a jazz singer.\n\nDr. Jennifer D. Turner is a Professor in Literacy Education and serves as the ADVANCE Professor for the College of Education. Dr. Turner’s research focuses on three interrelated areas: (a) Black young people’s freedom dreaming through arts-based methods; (b) future-affirming pedagogical practices in P-16 schools; and (c) intersectional multimodal research methods. Her current research explores how culturally responsive prompting for ChatGPT produces humanizing images of Black girls' intersectionality."

    "description": "How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America\n\nHow do schools make us think about race? And where does Latinx fit in?\n\nIn “How Schools Make Race,” Laura Chávez-Moreno, a researcher and former public school teacher, shows how schools play a pivotal role in shaping the concept of race and racialized groups.\n\nIn this talk, she tells the story of how the teachers and students in a racially diverse Spanish-English bilingual education program grappled with conflicting ideas about race and about the Latinx category.\n\nChávez-Moreno challenges us to reconsider what makes race and invites us to see Latinx as a racialized group. Her research reveals why this shift matters-–because how we think about race affects whether our schools can provide youth with an education that challenges racist ideas.\n\nLaura Chávez-Moreno is an award-winning scholar, qualitative social scientist, and assistant professor in the Department of Chicana/o & Central American Studies and the Department of Education at UCLA. She is the author of How Schools Make Race: Teaching Latinx Racialization in America, published by Harvard Education Press, which won the Book of the Year Award by an early career scholar from the American Association of Hispanics in Higher Education. Her book has been featured in several podcasts and popular media, including the New Books Network and Ms. Magazine . Professor Chávez-Moreno’s research has been published in top-tier academic journals and recognized with prestigious awards from organizations such as the American Educational Research Association and the National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation. In 2023, she received the Alan C. Purves Award from the National Council of Teachers of English for her article, “The continuum of racial literacies: Teacher practices countering whitestream bilingual education,” published in Research in the Teaching of English. This annual award honors the article deemed most significant in advancing the field. Most recently, Professor Chávez-Moreno was awarded the 2025 Emerging Scholars Award from the Critical Race Studies in Education Association.

With particular reverence for works that create unforgettable moments and a sense of perfect integrity without the need to adhere to any existing model, he discusses and performs works by J. S. Bach, Lily Boulanger, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Ernest Chausson. Also featured in the presentation is the School of Music’s new Assistant Professor of Collaborative Piano, Futaba Niekawa."

With over a dozen instrumental solo albums, Shimabukuro has shown an effortless skill at skating between styles, blasting his way through waves of staccato thirty-second notes with classical precision and ambling melodically through a heartwarming pop ballad. He has headlined performances at the Hollywood Bowl, Lincoln Center, the Sydney Opera House and the New Orleans Jazz Fest.

Davis unveils the development of punk fanzines and their role in supporting DC's hardcore and punk scene from the 1970s into the twenty-first century. He sheds new light on DC's scene and highlights some of its key personalities, including many who are often left out of punk history, with high-quality images of rare zines and insights from numerous interviews with zine creators and musicians. This book vividly weaves together the origin of zines and their importance in underground communities.\n\nFor punk enthusiasts, zine creators, American studies scholars, and anyone who has ever felt like an outsider, Keep Your Ear to the Ground traces how the unique environment of Washington, DC, helped zines thrive.\n\nJohn R. Davis is the curator of Special Collections in Performing Arts in the University of Maryland's Michelle Smith Performing Arts Library. His articles and commentary appear in the Washington Post , NPR , MLA Notes , The Journal of Popular Culture, Punk & Post-Punk, and The Journal of Digital Media Management."
